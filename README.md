# WoodlandPizza.github.io

This is a React Native mobile application for Woodland Take-N-Bake Pizza in Savage, MN.
It was created as a spec project, by UX designer Olivia Klavetter because she is such a fan of their pizza.
Following Via's designs I developed this app using a combination of React Native and Expo
