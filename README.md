# WoodlandPizza.github.io

This is a React Native mobile application for Woodland Take-N-Bake Pizza in Savage, MN.
It was created as a spec project, by UX designer Olivia Klavetter because she is such a fan of their pizza.
Following Via's designs I developed this app using a combination of React Native and Expo.

## How to View this Application

Since this application was created on spec, it is not yet deployed to either the App Store or to Google Play.
In order to view the application you need to first install the Expo app onto your smartphone.
In the App Store, search for Expo Client
In Google Play, search for Expo

Once the app is installed, use your phones camera to scan the appropriate QR code below:
